# Algorithm-Portal
These algortihms are based on the FCC FrontEnd developer projects. They represent a core part of the requirements needed to obtain the front End developer certificate.
There are 16 algorithms in this project. Update on this project will incorporate other sets of algorithms. The project is driven by the need to give a user friendly frontEnd view to non-programmers. With a brief explanation on what each algorithm does and how it works.
